UNEXPECTED ERROR
An unexpected error has occurred. Daniel did not have enough foresight to see this one coming.
At this point, you should call Daniel in and let him deal with his own mistake.
Alternatively, you can call in another computer science student and let them deal with Daniel's mess :)
Below is complete garbage that's meant for Daniel to look at. Daniel (or unfortunate computer science student), if you reading this, goodluck.
